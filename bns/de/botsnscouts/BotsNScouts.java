     * words, a logger is a category. Thus, all operations that can be performed
     * on a category can be performed on a logger. Internally, whenever log4j is
     * asked to produce a Category object, it will instead produce a Logger
     * object. Log4j 1.2 will never produce Category objects but only Logger
     * instances. In order to preserve backward compatibility, methods that
     * previously accepted category objects still continue to accept category
     * objects.
